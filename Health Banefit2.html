12 Powerful Ayurvedic Herbs and Spices with Health Benefits
Ayurveda is a traditional Indian system of medicine. It aims to preserve health and wellness by keeping the mind, body, and spirit in balance and preventing disease rather than treating it.

To do so, it employs a holistic approach that combines diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes (1Trusted Source).

Ayurvedic herbs and spices are also an important component of this approach. They’re thought to protect your body from disease and offer a variety of health benefits, including improved digestion and mental health.

Here are 12 Ayurvedic herbs and spices with science-backed health benefits.</p>

<p>1. Ashwagandha
Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is a small woody plant native to India and North Africa. Its root and berries are used to produce a very popular Ayurvedic remedy (2Trusted Source).</p>

<p>It’s considered an adaptogen, which means that it’s believed to help your body manage stress more effectively. Research has shown that it reduces levels of cortisol, a hormone that your adrenal glands produce in response to stress (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).</p>

There’s also evidence linking ashwagandha to lower levels of anxiety and improved sleep in people with stress and anxiety disorders (3Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).

Moreover, research shows that ashwagandha may enhance muscle growth, memory, and male fertility, as well as lower blood sugar levels. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these benefits (4Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).

Finally, there’s evidence that it may help reduce inflammation and boost your immune system, though more studies are needed (11, 12Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Ashwagandha is an Ayurvedic spice that may help your body manage stress more effectively. It may also lower your blood sugar levels and improve sleep, memory, muscle growth, and male fertility.

<p>2. Boswellia
Boswellia, also known as Indian frankincense or olibanum, is made from the resin of the Boswellia serrata tree. It’s known for its easily recognizable spicy, woody aroma.

Research suggests that it may be particularly effective at reducing inflammation by preventing the release of inflammation-causing compounds known as leukotrienes (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).

In test-tube and animal studies, boswellia appears to be as effective as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), yet with fewer side effects (15Trusted Source).

Human studies link boswellia to reduced pain, improved mobility, and a greater range of movement in people with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also help prevent oral infections and fight gingivitis (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).

Moreover, it may improve digestion in people with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, as well as breathing in people with chronic asthma (21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25).

SUMMARY
Boswellia is an Ayurvedic spice with anti-inflammatory properties. It may reduce joint pain, enhance oral health, and improve digestion, as well as increase breathing capacity in people with chronic asthma.</p>


<p>3–5. Triphala
Triphala is an Ayurvedic remedy consisting of the following three small medicinal fruits (26Trusted Source):

amla (Emblica officinalis, or Indian gooseberry)
bibhitaki (Terminalia bellirica)
haritaki (Terminalia chebula)
Test-tube and animal studies show that triphala may reduce inflammation caused by arthritis, as well as prevent or limit the growth of certain types of cancer (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).

It may also function as a natural laxative, reducing constipation, abdominal pain, and flatulence while improving the frequency and consistency of bowel movements in people with gut disorders (32Trusted Source, 33).

In addition, a limited number of studies suggest that a mouthwash containing triphala may reduce plaque buildup, decrease gum inflammation, and prevent the growth of bacteria in the mouth (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Triphala is an Ayurvedic remedy consisting of three Ayurvedic spices — amla, bibhitaki, and haritaki. It may help reduce joint inflammation, improve digestion, and promote oral health.

<p>6. Brahmi
Brahmi (Bacopa monieri) is a staple herb in Ayurvedic medicine.

According to test-tube and animal studies, brahmi appears to have strong anti-inflammatory properties that are as effective as common NSAIDs (36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source).

Studies also link it to improvements in learning rates, attention, memory, and information processing, as well as reduced symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as inattention, impulsivity, poor self-control, and restlessness (40Trusted Source, 41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).

Some studies further suggest that brahmi may have adaptogenic properties, which means that it may help improve your body’s ability to deal with stress and anxiety. However, more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source, 48Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Brahmi is an Ayurvedic herb believed to lower inflammation, improve brain function, and reduce symptoms of ADHD. It may also increase your body’s ability to deal with stress, though more research is needed.</p>


<p>7. Cumin
Cumin is a spice native to the Mediterranean and Southwest Asia. It’s made from the seeds of the Cuminum cyminum plant, which are known for their distinctive earthy, nutty, and spicy flavor.

Research shows that cumin may boost the activity of digestive enzymes and facilitate the release of bile from the liver, speeding digestion and easing the digestion of fats (49, 50Trusted Source).

Studies have also linked this Ayurvedic spice to reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), such as abdominal pain and bloating (51Trusted Source).

Plus, cumin may protect against type 2 diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity. It may also protect against heart disease by increasing HDL (good) cholesterol while reducing triglycerides and LDL (bad) cholesterol (52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source).

Cumin likewise appears to possess antimicrobial properties that may reduce the risk of certain foodborne infections. Still, more studies are needed to confirm this (57Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Cumin is an Ayurvedic spice commonly used to add flavor to meals. It may decrease symptoms of IBS, improve risk factors for type 2 diabetes and heart disease, and perhaps even offer some protection against foodborne infection.</p>



<p>8. Turmeric
Turmeric, the spice that gives curry its characteristic yellow color, is another popular Ayurvedic remedy.

Curcumin, its main active compound, has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Test-tube research shows that it may be equally or even more effective than some anti-inflammatory drugs — without all of their side effects (58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source, 60Trusted Source, 61Trusted Source).

Also, turmeric may help protect against heart disease, in part by improving blood flow as effectively as exercise or certain pharmaceutical drugs. One study further suggests that it may be as effective as Prozac, a drug commonly used to treat depression (62Trusted Source, 63Trusted Source, 64Trusted Source, 65Trusted Source).

Moreover, compounds in turmeric may help preserve brain function by increasing brain levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Low levels of BDNF have been linked to disorders like Alzheimer’s and depression (66Trusted Source, 67Trusted Source, 68Trusted Source, 69Trusted Source).

That said, most studies have used very large amounts of curcumin, whereas turmeric comprises only around 3% of this compound. Thus, amounts larger than those found in turmeric are likely needed to attain these health benefits, and such large doses may cause stomach upset (70Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Turmeric is the Ayurvedic spice that gives curry its yellow color. Curcumin, its main compound, may help reduce inflammation and improve heart and brain health. However, large amounts are likely needed to attain these benefits.</p>


<p>9. Licorice root
Licorice root, which is native to Europe and Asia, comes from the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant and holds a central place in Ayurvedic medicine.

Test-tube and human studies suggest that licorice root may help reduce inflammation and fight viruses and bacteria. It also appears to offer relief from a sore throat and promote oral health by protecting against dental cavities and Candida (71Trusted Source, 72Trusted Source, 73Trusted Source, 74Trusted Source, 75Trusted Source).

This Ayurvedic spice may likewise help prevent or manage heartburn, bloating, nausea, belching, and stomach ulcers. When applied to the skin, it may reduce symptoms of skin rash, including redness, itching, and swelling (76Trusted Source, 77Trusted Source, 78Trusted Source, 79Trusted Source).

However, the only studies on this root are generally small, and more research is needed to confirm these benefits.

SUMMARY
Licorice root is an Ayurvedic spice that may help reduce inflammation and protect against various infections. It may also treat digestive problems and relieve skin irritations.</p>



<p>10. Gotu kola
Gotu kola (Centella asiatica), or “the herb of longevity,” is another popular Ayurvedic remedy. It’s made from a tasteless, odorless plant with fan-shaped green leaves that grows in and around water.

One small study suggests that gotu kola supplements may improve people’s memory after they have had a stroke (80Trusted Source).

Moreover, in one study, people with generalized anxiety disorder reported less stress, anxiety, and depression after replacing their antidepressants with gotu kola for 60 days (81Trusted Source).

There is also some evidence that the herb may help prevent stretch marks, reduce varicose veins, help wounds heal faster, and diminish symptoms of eczema and psoriasis. However, more research is needed (82Trusted Source, 83Trusted Source, 84Trusted Source).

Animal studies further suggest that this Ayurvedic herb may relieve joint pain, but more studies are needed to confirm this effect (85Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Gotu kola is an Ayurvedic herb that may help boost memory and reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as improve a variety of skin conditions.</p>

<p>11. Bitter melon
Bitter melon (Momordica charantia) is a tropical vine closely related to zucchini, squash, cucumber, and pumpkin. It’s considered a staple in Asian cuisine and packed with nutrients and powerful antioxidants.

Research suggests that bitter melon may help lower blood sugar levels and promote the secretion of insulin, the hormone responsible for keeping blood sugar levels stable (86Trusted Source, 87Trusted Source, 88Trusted Source, 89).

If you use insulin to manage your blood sugar levels, consult your healthcare before adding bitter melon to your daily routine to prevent your blood sugar levels from becoming dangerously low.

Animal studies further suggest that it may lower triglyceride and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, though human studies are needed to confirm this (90Trusted Source, 91Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Bitter melon is an Ayurvedic spice that may help lower blood sugar levels and boost insulin secretion. It may also reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, though more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made.</p>


<p>12. Cardamom
Cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), which is sometimes referred to as the “queen of spices,” has been part of Ayurvedic medicine since ancient times.

Research suggests that cardamom powder may help reduce blood pressure in people with elevated levels. There’s also evidence that inhaling cardamom essential oil may increase the uptake of oxygen into the lungs during exercise (92Trusted Source, 93).

Moreover, test-tube and animal research suggests that cardamom may help protect against Helicobacter pylori bacteria, which is a common cause of stomach ulcers, and may reduce the size of gastric ulcers by at least 50% or even eradicate them (94Trusted Source, 95Trusted Source).

Still, research in humans is needed before strong conclusions can be made.

SUMMARY
Cardamom is an Ayurvedic spice that may lower blood pressure, improve breathing, and potentially help stomach ulcers heal. However, more research is necessary.

Precautions
Ayurvedic herbs and spices are generally considered safe when consumed in amounts typically used to prepare or flavor foods. Yet, most of the studies supporting their benefits typically used supplements offering doses far exceeding that.

Supplementing with such large doses may not be suitable for children, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people with known medical conditions, or those taking medication.

Therefore, it’s necessary to consult your healthcare provider before adding any Ayurvedic supplements to your regimen.

It’s also worth noting that the content and quality of Ayurvedic products are not regulated. Some Ayurvedic preparations may mix Ayurvedic herbs and spices with minerals, metals, or gems, rendering them potentially harmful (96Trusted Source).

For instance, a recent study found that 65% of Ayurvedic products studied contained lead, while 32–38% also included mercury and arsenic, some of which had concentrations that were up to several thousand times higher than the safe daily limit (97Trusted Source).

Another study reported that up to 40% of people who use Ayurvedic preparations had elevated levels of lead or mercury in their blood (98Trusted Source).

Therefore, those interested in Ayurvedic preparations should only purchase them from reputable companies that ideally have their products tested by a third party.

SUMMARY
Ayurvedic herbs and spices are generally safe in small amounts. Supplements containing large doses of these herbs and spices, as well as Ayurvedic preparations that have mixed them with other minerals, metals, or gems may be harmful.

The bottom line
Ayurvedic herbs and spices have been an integral part of traditional Indian medicine for centuries

An increasing amount of scientific evidence supports their many proposed health benefits, including protection against type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

Thus, adding small amounts of these herbs and spices may help both flavor your meals and boost your health.

That said, large doses may not be suitable for everyone, so make sure to seek advice from your healthcare provider before adding Ayurvedic supplements to your healthcare regimen.

And remember, Ayurveda employs a holistic approach to health that also includes physical activity, adequate sleep, stress management, and eating a variety of fruits and vegetables daily.</p>

7 Emerging Benefits of Bacopa monnieri (Brahmi)
Bacopa monnieri, also called brahmi, water hyssop, thyme-leaved gratiola, and herb of grace, is a staple plant in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.

It grows in wet, tropical environments, and its ability to thrive underwater makes it popular for aquarium use (1Trusted Source).

Bacopa monnieri has been used by Ayurvedic medical practitioners for centuries for a variety of purposes, including improving memory, reducing anxiety, and treating epilepsy (2Trusted Source).

In fact, research shows that it may boost brain function and alleviate anxiety and stress, among other benefits.

A class of powerful compounds called bacosides in Bacopa monnieri is believed to be responsible for these benefits.

Here are 7 emerging benefits of Bacopa monnieri.

We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process.

1. Contains powerful antioxidants
Antioxidants are substances that help protect against cell damage caused by potentially harmful molecules called free radicals.

Research suggests that damage caused by free radicals is linked to many chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers (3Trusted Source).

Bacopa monnieri contains powerful compounds that may have antioxidant effects (4).

For example, bacosides, the main active compounds in Bacopa monnieri, have been shown to neutralize free radicals and prevent fat molecules from reacting with free radicals (5Trusted Source).

When fat molecules react with free radicals, they undergo a process called lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is linked to several conditions, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurodegenerative disorders (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).

Bacopa monnieri may help prevent damage caused by this process.

For example, a study showed that treating rats with dementia with Bacopa monnieri reduced free radical damage and reversed signs of memory impairment (8Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Bacopa monnieri contains active compounds called bacosides, which have been shown to have antioxidant effects, especially in the brain.
2. May reduce inflammation
Inflammation is your body’s natural response to help heal and fight disease.

However, chronic, low-level inflammation has been linked to many chronic conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and heart and kidney disease (9Trusted Source).

In test-tube studies, Bacopa monnieri appeared to suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are molecules that stimulate an inflammatory immune response (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).

Also, in test-tube and animal studies, it inhibited enzymes, such as cyclooxygenases, caspases, and lipoxygenases — all of which play key roles in inflammation and pain (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).

What’s more, in animal studies, Bacopa monnieri had anti-inflammatory effects comparable to those of diclofenac and indomethacin — two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs commonly used to treat inflammation (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).

Nevertheless, more research is needed to determine whether Bacopa monnieri reduces inflammation in humans.

SUMMARY
Test-tube and animal studies show that Bacopa monnieri may have potent anti-inflammatory properties and suppress pro-inflammatory enzymes and cytokines.

3. May boost brain function
Research suggests that Bacopa monnieri may help enhance brain function.

For example, one study in mice showed that supplementing with Bacopa monnieri improved their spatial learning and ability to retain information (14Trusted Source).

The same study also found that it increased dendritic length and branching. Dendrites are parts of nerve cells in the brain that are closely linked to learning and memory (14Trusted Source).

Additionally, a 12-week study in 46 healthy adults observed that taking 300 mg of Bacopa monnieri daily significantly improved the speed of processing visual information, learning rate, and memory, compared with the placebo treatment (15Trusted Source).

Another 12-week study in 60 older adults found that taking either 300 mg or 600 mg of Bacopa monnieri extract daily improved memory, attention, and the ability to process information, compared with the placebo treatment (16Trusted Source).

SUMMARY
Animal and human studies show that Bacopa monnieri may help improve memory, attention, and the ability to process visual information.
4. May help reduce ADHD symptoms
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by symptoms like hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness (17Trusted Source).

Interestingly, research has shown that Bacopa monnieri may help reduce ADHD symptoms.

One study in 31 children aged 6–12 years found that taking 225 mg of Bacopa monnieri extract daily for 6 months significantly reduced ADHD symptoms, such as restlessness, poor self-control, inattention, and impulsivity in 85% of the children (18Trusted Source).

Another study in 120 children with ADHD observed that taking an herbal blend that contained 125 mg of Bacopa monnieri improved attention, cognition, and impulse control, compared with the placebo group (19Trusted Source).

Although these findings are promising, more large-scale studies examining the effects of Bacopa monnieri on ADHD are needed before it can be recommended as a treatment.

SUMMARY
Bacopa monnieri may help reduce ADHD symptoms, such as restlessness and self-control, but more large-scale human studies are needed.
5. May prevent anxiety and stress
Bacopa monnieri may help prevent anxiety and stress. It’s considered an adaptogenic herb, meaning that it increases your body’s resistance to stress (20Trusted Source).

Research suggests that Bacopa monnieri helps reduce stress and anxiety by elevating your mood and reducing levels of cortisol, a hormone that is closely linked to stress levels (21Trusted Source).

One rodent study showed that Bacopa monnieri had anti-anxiety effects comparable to those of lorazepam (benzodiazepine), a prescription medication used to treat anxiety (22Trusted Source).

However, human studies on Bacopa monnieri and anxiety show mixed results.

For example, two 12-week human studies found that taking 300 mg of Bacopa monnieri daily significantly reduced anxiety and depression scores in adults, compared with the placebo treatment (1Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).

Yet, another human study found that treatment with Bacopa monnieri had no effect on anxiety (23Trusted Source).

More large-scale human studies are needed to confirm its effects on stress and anxiety.

SUMMARY
Bacopa monnieri may help reduce stress and anxiety by elevating mood and reducing cortisol levels. However, human studies show mixed results.
6. May help lower blood pressure levels
High blood pressure is a serious health concern, as it places strain on your heart and blood vessels. This can weaken your heart and increase your risk of heart disease (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).

Research suggests that Bacopa monnieri may help keep blood pressure within a healthy range.

In one animal study, Bacopa monnieri reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. It did this by releasing nitric oxide, which helps dilate blood vessels, resulting in improved blood flow and lower blood pressure (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).

Another study showed that Bacopa monnieri significantly lowered blood pressure levels in rats that had elevated levels, but it had no effect in rats that had normal blood pressure levels (28).

However, one 12-week study in 54 healthy older adults found that taking 300 mg of Bacopa monnieri daily had no effect on blood pressure levels (1Trusted Source).

Based on current findings, Bacopa monnieri may lower blood pressure in animals with high blood pressure levels. Nevertheless, more human research is required to confirm these effects.

SUMMARY
Bacopa monnieri may help reduce blood pressure in animals with high blood pressure levels. However, human research in this area is lacking.

7. May have anticancer properties
Test-tube and animal studies have found that Bacopa monnieri may have anticancer properties.

Bacosides, the active class of compounds in Bacopa monnieri, have been shown to kill aggressive brain tumor cells and inhibit the growth of breast and colon cancer cells in test-tube studies (29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).

Additionally, Bacopa monnieri induced skin and breast cancer cell death in animal and test-tube studies (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).

Research suggests that the high levels of antioxidants and compounds like bacosides in Bacopa monnieri may be responsible for its cancer-fighting properties (29Trusted Source, 34, 35).

Keep in mind that these results are from test-tube and animal studies. Until there are more human studies on Bacopa monnieri and cancer, it cannot be recommended as a treatment.

SUMMARY
Bacopa monnieri has been shown to block the growth and spread of cancer cells in test-tube and animal studies, but human research is needed to confirm these effects.
Bacopa monnieri side effects
While Bacopa monnieri is considered safe, it may cause side effects in some people.

For example, it may cause digestive symptoms, including nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea (36Trusted Source).

Furthermore, bacopa monnieri is not recommended for pregnant women, as no studies have assessed the safety of its use during pregnancy (37Trusted Source).

Finally, it may interact with certain medications, including amitriptyline, a medication used for pain relief (38).

If you are taking any medications, speak with your healthcare provider before taking Bacopa monnieri.

SUMMARY
Bacopa monnieri is generally safe, but some people may experience nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea. Pregnant women should avoid this herb, while those on medications should speak with their healthcare provider before taking it.
How to take Bacopa monnieri
Bacopa monnieri can be purchased online and from health food stores.

It’s available in several forms, including capsules and powders.

Typical dosages for Bacopa monnieri extract in human studies range from 300–450 mg per day (39Trusted Source).

However, dosage recommendations can vary widely depending on the product you purchase. If you have questions regarding dosage, speak with a qualified health professional to ensure your safety.

The powdered form can be added to hot water to make a soothing tea. It can also be mixed with ghee — a form of clarified butter — and added to warm water to make an herbal drink.

Although Bacopa monnieri is considered safe for most people, speak with your healthcare provider before taking it to ensure your safety and proper usage.

SUMMARY
Bacopa monnieri is available in several forms but is most commonly taken in capsule form. Typical doses range from 300–450 mg per day.
The bottom line
Bacopa monnieri is an ancient Ayurvedic herbal remedy for many ailments.

Human studies show it may help boost brain function, treat ADHD symptoms, and reduce stress and anxiety. Furthermore, test-tube and animal studies have found that it may possess anticancer properties and reduce inflammation and blood pressure.

Although these potential health benefits are promising, more research on Bacopa monnieri is needed to understand its full effects in humans.
